# Sign Language Translation with GUI and Multilingual Support
This project aims to facilitate communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time sign language translation. Additionally, it supports multilingual translation, enabling users to translate sign language gestures into multiple spoken languages.

To run the GUI, execute the following command:

```bash
python gui.py
